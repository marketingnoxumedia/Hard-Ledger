# The Storage Moat — Remotion video

A 9:16, ~80-second kinetic-typography video built with [Remotion](https://remotion.dev),
narrating the self-storage / Public Storage "moat" investment story.

- **Format:** 1080 × 1920 (9:16 vertical), 30 fps, 2398 frames (~79.9s)
- **Composition id:** `StorageUnit`
- **Source:** `src/StorageVideo.tsx` (all scenes + timeline), `src/Root.tsx` (composition)

## Script

> There's a business on the edge of your town with no employees, no product, and
> no customers who ever leave. Last year it made four point eight billion dollars.
> Public Storage rents simple, unstaffed metal units. Low labour. Low upkeep. Rent
> due monthly. A unit rented and forgotten is close to pure margin. Once a facility
> is built, it runs on almost nothing. No inventory. Minimal staff. Automatic rent
> increases. And customers who rarely leave. The moat is unglamorous, and that's why
> it holds. Once your belongings are inside, moving them out costs a weekend and a
> truck. So a small annual rent increase is easier to accept than to fight. Occupancy
> holds through downturns — because the things that trigger storage are moves,
> divorces, downsizing. The exact things recessions produce. This is a REIT. Around
> four point eight billion dollars in annual revenue. A fortress balance sheet. Built
> on sheds. Facility operating margins run near seventy-nine percent. Same-store
> around seventy-eight. Net margin near thirty-seven. Once the building is up, there
> is almost nothing on the cost side. Boring is beautiful. The least glamorous corner
> of real estate — a shed you forget you're paying for — is one of the most profitable
> in the country. No brand. No buzz. Just rent. The absence of a story is part of why
> the margins survive.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm start          # opens Remotion Studio
```

## Render

```bash
npm run render     # -> out/storage-unit.mp4
```

In a headless environment where fonts are fetched through a TLS-intercepting
proxy, render with the pre-installed Chrome headless shell and allow the proxy
certificate:

```bash
npx remotion render StorageUnit out/storage-unit.mp4 \
  --browser-executable=/path/to/chrome-headless-shell \
  --ignore-certificate-errors
```

## Scenes

The script is split into 26 beats defined by the `SCENES` array in
`src/StorageVideo.tsx`, each with its own text, red focal token, background, and
duration timed to the narration. Scene kinds: `hook`, `lines` (staggered list),
`text` (word-by-word caption), `stat` (count-up number with optional bar — used
for `$4.8B`, `79%`, `78%`, `37%`), `impact` (the red "Boring is beautiful" beat),
and `outro`. Edit copy, highlight words, media, and timing directly in that array.

## Backgrounds & audio

- Narration lives at `public/voiceover.mp3` and is enabled via the `HAS_VOICEOVER`
  flag in `src/StorageVideo.tsx`. Scene durations are timed to the read.
- Most scenes have a full-bleed background (mixed stills + video) in
  `public/media/`, sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com) (free license);
  a few beats sit on solid black or red. Videos are pre-cropped to 1080×1920
  silent clips, shown at full brightness with a Ken Burns move, a text-only drop
  shadow for legibility, and quick cuts between scenes.

## Export note

`out/storage-unit.mp4` is the full-quality master. For platforms with an upload
cap, transcode a smaller copy, e.g.:

```bash
npx remotion ffmpeg -i out/storage-unit.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 21 -preset slow \
  -c:a aac -b:a 160k -movflags +faststart out/storage-unit-web.mp4
