# The Storage Moat — Remotion video

A 9:16, ~80-second kinetic-typography video built with [Remotion](https://remotion.dev),
narrating the self-storage / Public Storage "moat" investment story.

- **Format:** 1080 × 1920 (9:16 vertical), 30 fps, 2328 frames (~77.6s)
- **Composition id:** `StorageUnit`
- **Source:** `src/StorageVideo.tsx` (all scenes + timeline), `src/Root.tsx` (composition)

## Script

> There's a business on the edge of your town with no employees, no product, and
> no customers who ever leave. Last year it made four point eight billion dollars.
> Public Storage rents simple, unstaffed metal units. Low labour. Low upkeep. Rent
> due monthly. A unit rented and forgotten is close to pure margin. Once a facility
> is built, it runs on almost nothing. No inventory. Minimal staff. Automatic rent
> increases. And customers who rarely leave. The moat is unglamorous, and that's why
> it holds. Once your belongings are inside, moving them out costs a weekend and a
> truck. So a small annual rent increase is easier to accept than to fight. Occupancy
> holds through downturns — because the things that trigger storage are moves,
> divorces, downsizing. The exact things recessions produce. This is a REIT. Around
> four point eight billion dollars in annual revenue. A fortress balance sheet. Built
> on sheds. Facility operating margins run near seventy-nine percent. Same-store
> around seventy-eight. Net margin near thirty-seven. Once the building is up, there
> is almost nothing on the cost side. Boring is beautiful. The least glamorous corner
> of real estate — a shed you forget you're paying for — is one of the most profitable
> in the country. No brand. No buzz. Just rent. The absence of a story is part of why
> the margins survive.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm start          # opens Remotion Studio
```

## Render

```bash
npm run render     # -> out/storage-unit.mp4
```

In a headless environment where fonts are fetched through a TLS-intercepting
proxy, render with the pre-installed Chrome headless shell and allow the proxy
certificate:

```bash
npx remotion render StorageUnit out/storage-unit.mp4 \
  --browser-executable=/path/to/chrome-headless-shell \
  --ignore-certificate-errors
```

## Scenes

The script is split into 26 beats defined by the `SCENES` array in
`src/StorageVideo.tsx`, each with its own text, red focal token, background, and
duration timed to the narration. Scene kinds: `hook`, `lines` (staggered list),
`text` (word-by-word caption), `stat` (count-up number with optional bar — used
for `$4.8B`, `79%`, `78%`, `37%`), `impact` (the red "Boring is beautiful" beat),
and `outro`. Edit copy, highlight words, media, and timing directly in that array.

## Backgrounds & audio

- Narration lives at `public/voiceover.mp3` and is enabled via the `HAS_VOICEOVER`
  flag in `src/StorageVideo.tsx`. Scene durations are timed to the read.
- Most scenes have a full-bleed background (mixed stills + video) in
  `public/media/`, sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com) (free license);
  a few beats sit on solid black or red. Videos are pre-cropped to 1080×1920
  silent clips, shown at full brightness with a Ken Burns move, a text-only drop
  shadow for legibility, and quick cuts between scenes.

Every footage scene uses a distinct background (no repeats). Media credits
(Pexels, free license) — videos: warehouse aerial (3969002), industrial area
(32338863), wood-pallet yard (31025294), semi truck (17899033), stock-market

street aerial (29052852). Photos: dollar bills (4386469), cash briefcase

Audio (all in `public/`):
- **Narration** — ElevenLabs voice cloned from the client's reference video,
  sped +3% for pace (`voiceover.mp3`). Scene durations are timed to the read.
- **Music** — upbeat instrumental generated with ElevenLabs Music
  (`media/music.mp3`), ducked under the narration with fade in/out.
- **SFX** — ElevenLabs sound-generation: `sfx_whoosh` on cuts, `sfx_impact` on
  stat/impact beats, `sfx_chaching` on the revenue reveal. Cues live in the
  `SFX` array in `src/StorageVideo.tsx`.

## Additional reels

The repo holds several reels in the same house format, each its own Remotion
composition with its own footage under `public/<name>/` (no photo/video
background is reused across reels — only the cloned voice, `media/logo.png`, and
`media/sfx_*.mp3` are shared):

- **`YahooReel`** — "Know when to sell."
- **`CarWashReel`** — "The car wash play" (Wall Street car-wash rollup).
- **`OwnershipReel`** — "The ownership gap" (wealth concentration: the top 1%'s
  record share vs the bottom half). ~37s. Media credits (Pexels, free license) —
  videos: aerial luxury yacht (31873241), rising candlestick chart (30289537),
  dark trading-screen with green charts (38412249), aerial night skyline
  (32258501). Photos: stacked gold bars (386318), white domed luxury mansion
  (12594566). Note: the figures (top 1% ≈ a third of wealth, bottom 50% ≈ 2.5%,
  top 10% ≈ 90% of stocks) track widely reported US Federal Reserve
  distributional data but shift over time — verify against the latest release
  before publishing.
- **`AttReel`** — "The forecast trap" (AT&T reportedly walking away from mobile
  after a consultant forecast, then paying to re-enter). ~35s. Media credits
  (Pexels, free license) — videos: retro slider mobile phone (3878355), empty
  boardroom pan (6951299), busy Times Square crowd (34539087). Photos: upward
  glass skyscraper (374122), cellular tower (36962826), vintage telephone
  switchboard (2267635). Note: the AT&T / McKinsey "~900k by 2000" forecast, the
  ~$12.5B cost to re-enter (the 1994 McCaw Cellular acquisition), and the ~109M
  actual-subscribers figure are widely cited but vary across retellings — treat
  the specifics as approximate business folklore, not audited numbers, and
  verify before publishing.

## Export note

`out/storage-unit.mp4` is the full-quality master. For platforms with an upload
